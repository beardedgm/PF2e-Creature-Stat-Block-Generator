# PF2e Creature Stat Block Generator

This simple tool helps generate a basic Pathfinder 2e creature stat block directly in your browser. It uses a predefined data table and JavaScript to fill in numbers for the selected level and damage type.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Running a local HTTP server is recommended; for example, run `python -m http.server` in this directory.
2. Choose the creature level and damage type from the dropdown menus on the left.
3. Click **Generate Stat Block**. The right side of the page will display the creature's statistics along with example creatures for that level.

The page updates instantly as all code is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
